#Steps on How to use the DAPP

This DAPP is designed to track the supply chain process of coffee from the time it is harvested to the time it reaches consumer's cups.

The supply chain process of coffee in this example starts out when a farmer harvests the coffee and consecutively processes, packs and auctions the items for sale. After that, distributors can purchase and ship the coffee to retailers. Retailers, then receive the shipped goods and make it available for purchase for consumers at home. This is DAPP is used to track the source of coffee and the integrity in the supply chain process.

Details of the UML diagram are listed in the UML.docx file within this repo

The DAPP starts out with a form for farm details of the coffee source to be entered. This option is only available for farmers and it allows them to record when coffee is harvested (when the harvest button is clicked), processed (when the process button is clicked), packed (when the pack button is clicked) and  when the coffee is finally for sale (When ForSale button is clicked).
